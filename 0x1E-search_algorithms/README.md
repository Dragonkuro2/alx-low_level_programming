# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains the solutions for the "0x1E. C - Search Algorithms" project at Holberton School. The project is focused on understanding and implementing search algorithms in the C programming language.

## Made by 

This project was developed by [Hicham Bourezi](https://github.com/Dragonkuro2).

## Learning Objectives

By exploring this repository, you will gain knowledge and skills in the following areas:

- Understanding various search algorithms
- Implementing linear search and binary search algorithms
- Analyzing the best search algorithm for specific use cases
- Working with space complexity and big O notation

## Requirements

- Code should follow the Betty style guidelines.
- Compiling all files using gcc with specific options.
- Limiting global variables and functions per file.
- Including function prototypes in the header file `search_algos.h`.
- Using only the `printf` function for output.
- Following specific file naming conventions for big O notation.

## Usage

To compile the C files, use the provided compilation command with gcc:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o <output_file>
```

Replace <output_file> with the desired name of the executable file.

**Good luck and happy coding!**
